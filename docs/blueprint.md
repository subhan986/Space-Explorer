# **App Name**: Spacetime Explorer

## Core Features:

- Spacetime Fabric: 3D visualization of a deformable spacetime grid or surface. Shows deformation due to the presence and mass of objects.
- Object Management: Add, remove, and adjust properties (mass, initial position, initial velocity) of massive and orbiter objects.
- Simulation Control: Controls to start, pause, reset simulation. Adjust simulation speed.
- Trajectory Display: Display trajectories of orbiting objects. Allow users to adjust the camera perspective.
- Suggested parameters: Generative AI tool that can suggest starting parameters. Parameters are appropriate to get different visualizations such as orbits or slingshot trajectories. LLM assesses what parameters the user has changed already, and provides new suggestions accordingly.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space blue (#3B5998) to represent the vastness of space and gravity.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222) to give the feeling of deep space. Light value is around 13%.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2) to highlight interactive elements and trajectories, standing out against the dark background.
- Clean, sans-serif font for readability.
- Simple, geometric icons for controls.
- Separate UI controls from the 3D visualization area.
- Subtle animation effects for simulation start/pause.
